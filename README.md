# StreamWeave
**Programmable Streaming + Storage Rails for Creators**

*Tagline: "Stream It. Own It. Earn It."*


## 1. Project Overview

### What is StreamWeave?

StreamWeave is a next-generation creator platform that combines **live streaming**, **decentralized storage**, and **programmable micropayments** into a unified Filecoin-powered infrastructure. Unlike traditional platforms that trap creators in walled gardens, StreamWeave gives creators full ownership of their content, audience relationships, and revenue streams.

**Core Value Proposition:**
- **Stream It:** Live streaming with pay-per-minute viewer engagement
- **Own It:** Permanent, verifiable storage of all content on Filecoin
- **Earn It:** 97% revenue retention with instant, programmable payouts

### Expanding Filecoin Beyond Cold Storage

While Filecoin has established itself as the premier decentralized storage network for large-scale data archival, StreamWeave extends its utility into the **hot data economy** of live content creation. We transform Filecoin from a "cold storage solution" into a **live content infrastructure** that powers real-time creator economies.

**Key Innovations:**
- **WarmStorage Integration:** Seamless archival of live streams with cryptographic integrity
- **CDN-Enabled Streaming:** Low-latency global content delivery through Filecoin's edge network
- **Micropayment Rails:** Sub-second payment processing for real-time viewer interactions
- **Creator-First Economics:** Programmable revenue splits that favor content creators

This positions Filecoin as the foundational layer for the **$180B creator economy**, moving beyond enterprise storage into consumer-facing applications that generate consistent demand for Filecoin services.


## 2. Problem Definition & Clarity (20%)

### The Creator Economy Crisis

The current creator economy is fundamentally broken, extracting value from creators while providing minimal ownership or control:

#### Revenue Exploitation (30-45% Platform Fees)
- **YouTube:** Takes 45% of ad revenue, 30% of channel memberships
- **Twitch:** Takes 50% of subscription revenue, 30% of bits/donations
- **TikTok:** Pays creators as little as $20-40 per million views
- **Patreon:** Charges 5-12% platform fees plus payment processing

#### Censorship & Platform Risk
- **Arbitrary Demonetization:** Creators lose income overnight due to algorithm changes
- **Content Removal:** Years of work deleted without appeal processes
- **Shadow Banning:** Reduced visibility punishes creators for non-conforming content
- **Platform Dependency:** Creators have no recourse when platforms change policies

#### Limited Monetization Options
- **Binary Payment Models:** Subscription or ad-based only, no flexible viewer engagement
- **No Direct Fan Support:** Platforms control all payment relationships
- **Geographic Restrictions:** Payment systems exclude global audiences
- **Delayed Payouts:** Revenue held for 30-60 days, harming creator cashflow

#### Data & Audience Ownership
- **Platform Lock-in:** Creators can't export their audience relationships
- **Algorithm Control:** Platforms determine who sees creator content
- **Limited Analytics:** Creators lack detailed insights into their performance
- **Zero Portability:** Moving platforms means starting from zero

### Market Size & Urgency

- **$180B Global Creator Economy** (2023) growing 22% annually
- **50M+ professional creators** seeking platform alternatives
- **2.6B consumers** paying for creator content monthly
- **$12B in creator tools funding** (2022-2023) signals massive market demand

The timing is perfect: creators are actively seeking alternatives, consumers want more direct creator support, and Web3 infrastructure has matured enough to support real-world applications.

  replication: 3,
  verificationInterval: 3600, // 1 hour
  autoUpload: true
});

streamArchive.recordLiveStream(streamId)
  .then(segments => segments.forEach(segment => 
    filecoin.store(segment.data, {
      duration: '2 years',
      redundancy: 3,
      retrievalSLA: '< 100ms'
    })
  ));
```

  autoSplit: {
    creator: 0.85,
    collaborators: 0.10,
    platform: 0.03,
    charity: 0.02
  }
});

viewer.watchStream(streamId)
  .onTimeUpdate((watchTime) => {
    payment.processIncremental(watchTime, viewer.wallet);
  })
  .onStreamEnd(() => {
    payment.finalizeTransaction();
  });

Segmented into 10-second chunks → Uploaded to WarmStorage → 
Proof-of-Storage initiated → Content addressable via IPFS CID
```

**2. Content Delivery:**
```
Viewer requests stream → FilCDN identifies optimal edge location → 
Retrieves content from nearest storage provider → 
Delivers adaptive bitrate stream → Monitors quality and latency
```

**3. Payment Processing:**
```
Viewer watches content → Payment channel tracks time/engagement → 
Smart contract calculates fees → Instant revenue distribution → 
Creator receives 97% of payments → Platform retains 3% for infrastructure
```
